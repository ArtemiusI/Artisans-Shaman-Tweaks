The Shaman kit added by the Enhanced Edition is more than a little half-baked. The kit's progression is literally copied from that of the Sorcerer with their 8th and 9th levels removed, one of the slowest leveling classes in the game, without regard for how the divine spellcaster's scaling adjusts to that. They don't even have a stat-based spell slot bonus like divine casters! As a result, the Shaman progresses extremely awkwardly as a spellcaster compared to the cleric and druid, having a higher than normal number of casts when first unlocking a new spell level, but gaining new spells and casts per day at a painfully slow pace as a tradeoff with significantly fewer casts per day. This small mod hopes to remedy that a little by giving the Shaman a more even curve, changing their experience table to that of a cleric, as well as adjusting their spell learning and max casts per day at a more consistent pace, giving a nice alternative for the druid spellbook to the druid class itself that has an unusual progression that tapers off at level 14, which the Shaman will not need to deal with.

To summarize, the Shaman now has the following changes:

— Now uses the Cleric's experience table rather than the Sorcerer's.

— Gains max casts per day at a slower rate to compensate for the faster level ups, gaining an extra cast per two levels gained instead of one. However, their maximum casts per spell level caps at eight instead of six at higher levels.

— Upon unlocking the next spell level, learns two new spells immediately instead of only one, and learns a maximum of six spells per level.
